What is *Numerical Methods for Machine Learning*? (ML)

In short, for training an ML model, a computer steps through millions of instructions that are formulated in terms of mathematical expressions. 
Same holds for evaluating a model.

In order to describe we introduce the general concepts

 * algorithm
 * exception
 * accuracy
 * stability
